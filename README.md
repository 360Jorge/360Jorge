# Hi, I'm Jorge Guzman!

I'm passionate about using mathematics and data science to better understand the world — and ideally, help improve it.

## Interests
- Algebraic topology & representation theory  
- Topological data analysis (TDA) & applications to real-world data     
- Pure math research with a vision for impact and teaching

## Current Focus
- Learning and applying **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** with Python  
- Building math content and problem-solving tools to connect with learners and aspiring researchers  
- Exploring how **applied math** and **AI** intersect in domains like medicine, education, and governance  
- Preparing for grad school with an eye toward meaningful, funded PhD programs

## Let's Collaborate
I'm open to:
- Research opportunities in data analysis, machine learning, or mathematical applications  
- Projects that connect mathematics with real-world problems  
- Collaborations on educational content for math or AI
